  <hr>
  <p>Musician, beer geek, and JavaScript enthusiast. I've spent more than half my life living in Denver, and after years providing IT training, support, and consultation I decided to go for broke and pursue programming as a full-time career. Now, nothing is as fun, challenging, or rewarding for me than creating elegant, scalable, performant software solutions with JavaScript.</p>

  <p>
  I love writing static front-end pages, server-side rendered applications, single-page apps and everything in between. As a lifelong learner, my passion is discovering and improving skills every day, and with a heart for training, mentoring, and development, I love sharing what I learn and helping others level up.
